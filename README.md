Random C sharp tools

### checkin
This is a little utility that simply checks into a remote server via a GET request.


### stopAV
This little tool will check the current AV, and if it is Defender, will add folder exclusion for the current folder. 

Has a switch statement for easy to add checks and actions for other AV/EDR vendors.
