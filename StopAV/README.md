## stopAV

This tool is a work in progress. Currently simply checks for the AV/EDR running, and if it is Defender, adds the current directory to the AV exclusions. 

Has a switch statement that goes through what to do depending on the AV/EDR detected. Should be fairly modular to add new AV/EDR's to the tool.

PR's welcome :)
